A policy framework proposing NATO-style multinational coordination for sustainable open source infrastructure funding (€200-300M annually from democratic nations)

# Digital Infrastructure Alliance
## A Multinational Framework for Open Source Sustainability

---

### TL;DR

Open source infrastructure contributes €65-95 billion annually to the EU economy ($8.8 trillion globally), yet remains chronically underfunded and maintained largely by volunteers. While Germany's Sovereign Tech Fund demonstrates that public funding works (€23 million invested in 60+ projects), single-nation programs don't scale effectively.

This repository proposes a **Digital Infrastructure Alliance**—a treaty-based multinational framework modeled on NATO and ESA that pools resources from participating democracies to sustainably fund critical open source infrastructure.

**Core concept:** 10-15 democratic nations contribute proportionally (~0.001% of GDP), generating €200-300 million annually in coordinated funding. Treaty-based governance ensures institutional resilience, technical merit drives funding decisions, and burden-sharing distributes costs equitably.

## The Problem

**Chronic Underfunding:**
- 96% of codebases contain open source components
- Critical infrastructure often maintained by single, unpaid volunteers
- xz Utils backdoor (2024) exploited maintainer burnout through social engineering
- EU's Next Generation Internet program cut from €27M to €10M despite supporting 500+ projects

**Fragmented Response:**
- Germany's STF: €23M invested, but received 500 applications requesting €114M (massive unmet demand)
- Corporate sponsorship: inconsistent and strategically selective
- Individual government programs operate in isolation with duplicated effort

**The Free-Rider Problem:**
Every entity using open source benefits; few contribute proportionally. This structural issue requires structural solutions—coordinated frameworks that align incentives and distribute costs.

## The Proposal

### Digital Infrastructure Alliance Framework

**Governance Model:**
- Treaty-based international organization (precedent: NATO, ESA, CERN)
- Governing Council (member state representatives, weighted voting)
- Technical Advisory Board (experts, merit-based assessment)
- Operational staff (low-bureaucracy, following STF model)

**Funding Structure:**
- Minimum contribution: €5 million annually
- Scaled contribution: ~0.001% of GDP for larger economies
- Projected: €200-300M annually from 10-15 founding members
- Industry co-funding welcomed but governance remains public

**Allocation (Provisional):**
- Critical Infrastructure Maintenance: 50% (€50k-500k per project)
- Ecosystem Strengthening: 30% (security audits, accessibility, documentation)
- Strategic Gap Filling: 15% (areas where open alternatives needed)
- Emergency Response: 5% (zero-days, maintainer crisis support)

**Founding Member Candidates:**
Germany, France, Japan, UK, Italy, Canada, South Korea, Spain, Netherlands, Switzerland, Sweden, Poland, Norway, Australia—democracies facing shared digital infrastructure dependencies.

## Why This Might Work

### Economic Case

European governments spend €10-20 billion annually on proprietary software licenses. The alliance's €300 million represents 1.5-3% of current licensing costs.

**Return on Investment:**
- Schleswig-Holstein saves €18M annually migrating 30,000 workstations to Linux
- Reduced IT support overhead and extended hardware lifecycles
- Elimination of forced upgrade cycles
- Improved procurement leverage against proprietary vendors

Alliance funding enables migration away from vendor lock-in, making ROI positive within years as licensing savings exceed contributions.

### Political Timing

**Critical Window (Now):**
- EU 2028-2034 budget negotiations underway (final adoption Q2 2026)
- Digital sovereignty is stated policy priority post-Trump, post-NSA revelations
- Germany's STF provides proven operational model
- NGI cuts created community anger and policy attention

**Geopolitical Tailwinds:**
- Draghi Report (Sept 2024): "EU relies on foreign countries for 80%+ of digital infrastructure"
- US-China tech competition forcing strategic choices
- Security incidents (xz Utils, SolarWinds) demonstrating infrastructure vulnerability
- Ukraine war heightening security/sovereignty concerns

### Structural Advantages

**Over Single-Nation Programs:**
- Distributed political risk (survives individual elections)
- Economies of scale (one application process, not 10)
- Coordinated priorities (no duplication or gaps)
- Institutional resilience (treaty framework transcends political cycles)

**Over Corporate Funding:**
- Aligned with long-term commons sustainability vs. quarterly earnings
- Insulated from private strategic shifts
- Addresses free-rider problem through coordinated burden-sharing

### What We're NOT Looking For

- Generic "this will never work" without specifics
- Demands that perfect be enemy of good
- Advocacy for specific vendors or products
- Attempts to monetize or capture this framework

## Principles

### Open and Collaborative

**License:** CC BY 4.0 - Use, adapt, distribute freely with attribution

**Philosophy:** Better open source funding benefits everyone. If these ideas get incorporated into other advocacy work without attribution, that's success. Goal is impact, not credit.

**Transparency:** All documents, reasoning, and research shared openly. No hidden agendas, corporate backing, or undisclosed interests.

### Politically Agnostic

This framework intentionally avoids partisan positioning:
- Works for left (public investment in commons) and right (fiscal efficiency, sovereignty)
- Appealing to multiple ideological perspectives is feature, not bug
- Technical merit and sustainability, not political favoritism, should drive funding

### Community-Driven

Professional advocates will refine and champion this if they find it useful. Community validation and feedback improve the framework and provide legitimacy. Your input matters.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### "Why not just industry funding?"

Corporate open source contributions are valuable but face structural limitations: quarterly earnings pressures, strategic capture risks, and persistence of free-rider dynamics. Public funding provides baseline sustainability while corporate contributions remain welcome. See Section VI of policy brief.

### "Won't this just fund American projects?"

Governance structure explicitly addresses geographic diversity. Technical merit drives funding, but strategic gap-filling prioritizes areas where European alternatives could be fostered. Transparency requirements prevent any single bloc from dominating. See Section III of policy brief.

### "How is this different from Linux Foundation?"

Scale, funding source, and governance. Linux Foundation (~€177M/year) relies on corporate members. Alliance pools public funding (€200-300M/year), uses treaty-based governance with democratic accountability, and focuses on infrastructure sustainability rather than specific project ecosystems.

### "This seems politically impossible"

Maybe. But the window is open now: EU budget negotiations are live, Germany's STF proves viability, NGI cuts created momentum, and digital sovereignty is policy priority. Even if full vision doesn't materialize, partial success (EU-STF + voluntary coordination) would be valuable. See Section VII of policy brief.

### "What about [existing initiative]?"

This framework complements rather than replaces existing efforts. Germany's STF continues, potential EU-STF remains valuable, corporate foundations keep operating. This proposes coordination layer that enhances rather than duplicates.

## About This Project

### Origin

This framework emerged from observation of converging trends: NGI funding elimination, Germany's STF success, ongoing EU budget negotiations, and persistent open source sustainability challenges. Written by a community member (not policy expert, not representing any organization) who researched the landscape and attempted systematic thinking about coordination mechanisms.

### Goals

1. **Immediate:** Provide advocacy organizations with framework they can use during 2028-2034 EU budget negotiations
2. **Medium-term:** Influence how governments think about open source infrastructure funding
3. **Long-term:** Establish sustainable, coordinated model for digital commons investment

### Non-Goals

- Personal credit or recognition
- Monetization or commercial capture
- Partisan political positioning
- Perfect solution (better is enemy of good enough)
