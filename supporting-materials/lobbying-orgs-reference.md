# Open Source Lobbying Organizations - Quick Reference
## Key Contacts for Digital Infrastructure Alliance Brief

---

## Why These Organizations Matter

**The Brussels Lobbying Context:**
- ~25,000 lobbyists operate in Brussels
- Most represent corporate interests (tech giants, industry groups)
- Open source has small but professional dedicated advocacy presence
- These orgs are registered in EU Transparency Register, have access to MEPs and Commission
- They organize the policy events where decisions get influenced

**What Makes Them Different:**
Open source represents the "Fourth Sector"—community interests that are neither purely commercial, governmental, nor traditional NGO. These organizations navigate that unique space professionally.

**Your Opportunity:**
They're already advocating for open source funding. They commissioned studies (OFE did the EU-STF feasibility study). What they DON'T have is your multinational treaty-based coordination framework. That's the value you're bringing.

## The Four Organizations to Contact First

### 1. Open Forum Europe (OFE) - START HERE

**Why they're #1:**
- Literally commissioned the EU-STF study with GitHub that your brief builds on
- THE primary open source lobbying organization in Brussels (founded 2002)
- Organize EU Open Source Policy Summit (largest policy/community gathering)
- Direct, ongoing relationships with European Commission DG CONNECT and MEPs
- In the room during budget negotiations RIGHT NOW

**What they do:**
- Professional policy advocacy and lobbying
- Research and policy papers
- Coordinate community responses to EU legislation
- Organize high-level policy events
- Successfully influenced Cyber Resilience Act to protect open source

**Key People:**
- Executive Director: Astor Nummelin Carlberg
- Policy team (direct Commission/Parliament engagement)

**Contact Info:**
- Policy team: policy@openforumeurope.org
- General: info@openforumeurope.org
- Website: https://openforumeurope.org/
- Office: Avenue des Arts 56, 1000 Brussels, Belgium
- EU Transparency Register: Yes (official lobbyist status)

**How to approach:**
"Your EU-STF feasibility study is excellent. I've drafted a framework extending that concept to multinational treaty-based coordination (NATO-style burden sharing) that could bring in Canada, Japan, South Korea alongside EU members. Thought you might find it useful for ongoing advocacy. Happy to discuss or incorporate feedback."

**What they can do with this:**
- Present framework to their MEP contacts during budget negotiations
- Include in EU Open Source Policy Summit discussions
- Coordinate with other advocacy orgs for unified messaging
- Connect you with policymakers if framework gains traction

### 2. Free Software Foundation Europe (FSFE)

**Why they matter:**
- Community trust and legitimacy (not corporate-captured)
- Long track record (since 2001) of successful EU campaigns
- Already mobilized on NGI funding cuts (your exact issue)
- Can organize grassroots community support

**What they do:**
- Digital rights and software freedom advocacy
- "Public Money, Public Code" campaign (governments should open-source publicly funded code)
- EU procurement and open standards policy
- Community organizing and mobilization

**Their superpower:**
When they mobilize community (open letters, petitions, developer testimonials), policymakers listen because it's genuine grassroots, not astroturf.

**Recent wins:**
- Public procurement reform advocacy
- Router freedom campaign
- Digital sovereignty messaging

**Contact Info:**
- Policy team: policy@fsfe.org
- General: contact@fsfe.org
- Press: press@fsfe.org
- Website: https://fsfe.org/contact/

**How to approach:**
"NGI cuts demonstrate fragility of single-region programs. This framework proposes institutionally resilient alternative through multinational coordination. Given FSFE's work on digital sovereignty and public funding, thought you'd find it relevant."

**What they can do:**
- Mobilize community support (open letters, developer testimonials)
- Coordinate grassroots advocacy campaign
- Provide ideological/philosophical backing that industry groups can't
- Connect to activist networks across Europe

### 3. Linux Foundation Europe

**Why they matter:**
- Resources and industry connections
- Bridge between corporate sponsors and community
- European focus (established 2022 specifically for EU engagement)
- Connection to major projects (Linux kernel, CNCF, many others)

**What they do:**
- EU regulatory compliance for major projects
- Industry coordination on policy positions
- Technical credibility in policy discussions
- Leverage corporate relationships for advocacy

**Their unique position:**
Can bring both technical community AND corporate sponsors to the table. Industry co-funding proposals become credible when LF Europe is involved.

**Key People:**
- Gabriele Columbro (General Manager) - recently spoke about funding gaps at EU Open Source Policy Summit

**Contact Info:**
- General: info@linuxfoundation.eu
- Website: https://linuxfoundation.eu/about/contact/

**How to approach:**
"Gabriele Columbro noted the gap between seed funding and sustainable ecosystems. This framework addresses that through coordinated public investment. LF Europe's industry connections could be valuable for co-funding mechanisms."

**What they can do:**
- Mobilize corporate sponsors for matching programs
- Provide technical expertise for framework refinement
- Connect to major projects that benefit from sustained funding
- Leverage industry relationships with national governments

### 4. Open Source Initiative (OSI)

**Why they matter:**
- Define what "open source" means (standard-setter)
- Community legitimacy and trust
- Recent success coordinating community on Cyber Resilience Act
- Proven ability to organize across organizations

**What they do:**
- Coordinate community responses to legislation
- Work with OFE and European affiliates on policy
- Represent "Fourth Sector" community interests
- Maintain open source definition and standards

**Their recent win:**
Coordinated open source community to successfully influence Cyber Resilience Act, preventing existential threat to open source development. Showed they can mobilize when needed.

**Contact Info:**
- General: info@opensource.org
- Website: https://opensource.org/contact

**Note:** OSI doesn't have dedicated Brussels office but coordinates with European affiliates and OFE. Include for legitimacy and community organizing capability.

**How to approach:**
"Following OSI's successful coordination on CRA, this framework proposes institutional structure for sustainable funding advocacy. Your community organizing experience could inform implementation."

**What they can do:**
- Coordinate unified messaging across foundations and projects
- Provide standard-setting authority (what counts as eligible open source)
- Mobilize broader community for advocacy moments
- Connect to global open source community beyond Europe

---

## How They Work Together

**Current Reality:**
These organizations already coordinate (meetings, shared strategy, division of labor). OFE often convenes, FSFE mobilizes community, LF Europe brings industry, OSI provides standards/legitimacy.

**On Your Brief:**
If OFE likes the framework, they'll likely share with FSFE and LF Europe naturally. Your job is just to seed it with the right people.

**What Success Looks Like:**
- OFE incorporates framework into their EU-STF advocacy
- FSFE mobilizes community support with open letter
- LF Europe brings industry co-funding proposals
- OSI validates technical governance structure

They each play different roles. You don't need all four to champion it—but if even ONE finds it useful, you've succeeded.

## Practical Sending Strategy

**Week 1: OFE First**
Send to OFE policy team, give them 5-7 days to respond. They're the most directly relevant (commissioned EU-STF study).

**Week 1-2: FSFE and LF Europe**
Send shortly after OFE (can mention you've shared with OFE if they respond positively). These can go simultaneously.

**Week 2: OSI**
Send last of the four, can mention coordination with European orgs if relevant.

**Template to Use:**
Use "Template A: For Tier 1 Advocacy Organizations" from the email templates document, but customize based on the specific angles above for each org.

**If No Response:**
One polite follow-up after 2 weeks, then move on. They're busy, might not respond even if they find it useful. Don't take it personally.

**If Positive Response:**
Ask what would make it more useful, offer to revise, connect them with each other if they're not already coordinating (they probably are).

## Why Brussels vs. National Capitals?

**Brussels is where EU budget gets decided.** 
- European Commission proposes
- European Parliament and Council negotiate
- Final budget adopted by both

National capitals matter too (member states vote in Council), but Brussels lobbying is where the day-to-day influence happens.

**These organizations:**
- Have Brussels offices (or close coordination with Brussels presence)
- Attend Commission consultations and Parliament hearings
- Organize events in Brussels around FOSDEM and policy sessions
- Know which MEPs sit on Budget Committee (BUDG) and Industry Committee (ITRE)

**You don't need to lobby yourself.** 
Your role: provide the framework to people who do this professionally. They know how to get it in front of the right MEPs and Commission officials.

---

## What Happens After You Send?

**Best case:**
OFE says "This is exactly what we needed—the multinational angle solves problems we've been wrestling with." They incorporate it into advocacy, invite you to present at EU Open Source Policy Summit, coordinate with other orgs.

**Realistic case:**
One or two orgs find it useful, incorporate elements into their own materials, acknowledge the contribution, maybe ask clarifying questions. Your framework influences their advocacy even if you don't see immediate results.

**Worst case:**
Polite acknowledgment but no action. They're too busy, or it doesn't fit their current strategy, or they disagree with the approach. That's fine—you tried, and at least it's in front of people who might use it later.

**All three outcomes are acceptable.**
The goal isn't personal credit; it's getting a better funding model for open source infrastructure. If your ideas get used without attribution, that's success.

## Key Dates and Context

**EU Budget Timeline:**
- Commission proposal: Published July 2025 (already done)
- Negotiations: Ongoing through Q1-Q2 2026
- Final adoption: Target Q2 2026 for Jan 2028 implementation
- **Window is NOW**

**Relevant Events:**
- FOSDEM 2026: February 1-2 (Brussels) - major gathering
- EU Open Source Policy Summit: Typically day before FOSDEM
- Brussels Open Tech Week: Week around FOSDEM

**NGI Context:**
NGI funding was €27M supporting 500+ projects. Eliminated from 2025 draft, replaced with €10M "Open Europe Stack". Community is angry. Your framework offers constructive alternative.

**STF Context:**
Germany's Sovereign Tech Fund budget grew from €3.5M (2022) to €19M (2025). Proven model, but doesn't scale alone. Your framework shows how to scale through coordination.

## Final Checklist Before Sending

- [ ] Read your own brief thoroughly (make sure you agree with everything)
- [ ] Customize email for each org (don't copy-paste generic template)
- [ ] PDF is clean and professional (convert from markdown)
- [ ] Send in early January (not late December, not August)
- [ ] Follow up once after 2 weeks if no response
- [ ] Don't expect immediate results—policy moves slowly
- [ ] Be gracious if they ignore you or disagree
- [ ] Remember: you're helping them, not the other way around

**You're providing value to professionals.** They need frameworks, ideas, arguments. You've done the research and synthesis work. That's useful even if you're not an expert.

**Worst that happens:** They ignore it.
**Best that happens:** Your framework influences EU budget negotiations and creates multinational funding model.

Both outcomes cost you nothing but time. Send it.
