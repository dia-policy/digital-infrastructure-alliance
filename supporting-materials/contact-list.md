## Understanding the Brussels Lobbying Ecosystem

**Scale:** Approximately 25,000 lobbyists operate in Brussels, most representing corporate interests. Open source has dedicated but small advocacy presence.

**How It Works:**
- Registered lobbyists in EU Transparency Register (https://www.lobbyfacts.eu/)
- Direct meetings with European Commission officials and MEPs
- Policy papers, position statements, consultation responses
- Organized events (summits, workshops) bringing policymakers and community together
- Coordination across organizations for unified messaging

**Open Source "Fourth Sector":**
Unlike traditional lobbying (corporate, NGO, government), open source represents community interests—neither purely commercial nor purely civic. Organizations below navigate this unique space.

**Your Strategic Position:**
You're providing a policy framework to professional advocates already in the room. They have relationships; you have a novel coordination model (multinational treaty-based) they haven't fully articulated. That's valuable.

## Distribution Strategy Overview

**Phase 1 (Week 1):** Tier 0 - Dedicated lobbying orgs for feedback/refinement
**Phase 2 (Week 2):** Tier 1 - Supporting orgs and operational model (Sovereign Tech Agency)
**Phase 3 (Week 3):** Tier 2-3 - Technical community and projects
**Phase 4 (Ongoing):** Media and broader distribution as advocacy orgs circulate to policy contacts

**Timing Note:** January 2-15, 2026 optimal (post-holidays, EU budget negotiations active). Avoid late December and August.

## Tier 0: Dedicated Open Source Lobbying Organizations (ABSOLUTE HIGHEST PRIORITY)

These are professional lobbying/advocacy organizations that literally exist to influence EU policy on open source. They have Brussels offices, direct relationships with MEPs and Commission officials, and active ongoing campaigns. **Start here.**

### Open Forum Europe (OFE)
**Context:** THE primary open source policy think tank and lobbying organization in Brussels. Founded 2002, exclusively focused on EU digital policy and open source advocacy.

**What they do:**
- Commissioned the GitHub EU-STF feasibility study (the work your brief builds on)
- Organize annual EU Open Source Policy Summit (largest assembly of policymakers and open source community)
- Coordinate "Brussels Open Tech Week" around FOSDEM
- Direct, regular meetings with European Commission DG CONNECT and MEPs
- Successfully lobbied on Cyber Resilience Act to protect open source developers
- Member of EU Transparency Register (official lobbyist status)

**Key People:**
- Executive Director: Astor Nummelin Carlberg (moderates policy panels, coordinates advocacy)
- Policy team directly engages with Commission and Parliament

**Contact:**
- General: info@openforumeurope.org
- Policy team: policy@openforumeurope.org
- Website: https://openforumeurope.org/contact/
- Address: Avenue des Arts 56, 1000 Brussels, Belgium

**Why them first:** They literally commissioned the EU-STF study your brief extends. They're in the room with policymakers RIGHT NOW during budget negotiations. If anyone can actually get this framework in front of decision-makers, it's them. They organize the major policy events where these discussions happen.

**Your angle:** "Your EU-STF study is excellent. This brief proposes extending that concept to multinational treaty-based coordination, bringing in non-EU democracies. Thought you might find the framework useful for ongoing advocacy."

---

### Free Software Foundation Europe (FSFE)
**Context:** Long-established (2001) digital rights and software freedom organization. Major player in EU policy advocacy with strong community trust.

**What they do:**
- "Public Money, Public Code" campaign (successful advocacy for government open source adoption)
- EU policy engagement on procurement, open standards, digital sovereignty
- Protested NGI funding cuts (active on exactly your issue)
- Community organizing and grassroots mobilization
- Member of EU Transparency Register

**Philosophy:** Ideologically committed to software freedom, not corporate-captured. This gives them credibility with both technical community and policymakers skeptical of industry lobbying.

**Key Campaigns:**
- Public procurement reform (governments should publish code they fund)
- Router freedom (user control of network equipment)
- Digital sovereignty and independence from Big Tech

**Contact:**
- General: contact@fsfe.org
- Policy team: policy@fsfe.org
- Press: press@fsfe.org
- Website: https://fsfe.org/contact/contact.html

**Why them:** Community trusts them (won't be accused of corporate interests), proven track record of successful campaigns, already mobilized on NGI cuts. They can get grassroots community support behind this framework.

**Your angle:** "NGI cuts demonstrate the fragility of single-region funding. This framework proposes institutionally resilient alternative through multinational coordination. Given FSFE's advocacy on digital sovereignty and public funding, thought you'd find it relevant."

---

### Linux Foundation Europe
**Context:** European entity of Linux Foundation, established 2022 specifically to engage with EU regulatory environment and policy.

**What they do:**
- Bridge between major technical projects and European policymakers
- EU regulatory compliance guidance for projects

- Coordinate corporate and community interests in EU context

**Strengths:**
- Connection to major projects (Linux kernel, CNCF, many others)

- Resources for sustained advocacy campaigns
- Technical credibility

**Key People:**
- Gabriele Columbro (General Manager, Linux Foundation Europe) - spoke at EU Open Source Policy Summit about funding gaps

**Contact:**
- General: info@linuxfoundation.eu
- Website: https://linuxfoundation.eu/about/contact/

**Why them:** Can mobilize both corporate sponsors and major projects. Bridge to industry co-funding proposals. Resources to support sustained advocacy.

**Your angle:** "Gabriele Columbro recently noted the gap between seed funding and sustainable business ecosystems for open source. This framework proposes addressing that through coordinated public investment. LF Europe's industry connections could be valuable for co-funding discussion."

---

### Open Source Initiative (OSI) - European Engagement
**Context:** Global organization that defines "open source," increasingly active in EU policy especially after Cyber Resilience Act.

**What they do:**
- Coordinate community responses to EU legislation
- Work with OFE on policy advocacy

- Standard-bearer for what counts as open source

**Recent Success:**
- Coordinated open source community response to Cyber Resilience Act
- Prevented existential threat to open source development through sustained advocacy
- Demonstrated ability to mobilize community for policy engagement

**Contact:**
- Policy engagement: info@opensource.org (they coordinate with European affiliates)
- Website: https://opensource.org/contact

**Note:** OSI doesn't have dedicated Brussels office but coordinates with OFE and European affiliates. Include them for community legitimacy and standard-setting authority.

**Why them:** Define what "open source" means, community legitimacy, proven ability to organize coordinated advocacy campaigns across organizations.

**Your angle:** "Following OSI's successful coordination on CRA, this framework proposes institutional structure for sustainable funding advocacy. Your community organizing experience could be valuable."

- Open Forum Europe (MOST IMPORTANT - they commissioned EU-STF study)
- FSFE (community credibility)
- Linux Foundation Europe (industry bridge)
- OSI (community coordination)

Get their feedback, refine based on their expertise, build coalition willing to champion.

**Phase 2 (Week 2):** Send to Tier 1 - Operational model and supporting orgs
- Sovereign Tech Agency (operational expertise)
- OW2 and other European open source groups
- Research institutions (Fraunhofer, EUI)

**Phase 3 (Week 3):** Tier 2 & 3 - Technical community

- Technical community leaders  
- Conference organizers

**Phase 4 (Ongoing):** Media and broader circulation
- Technical journalism (LWN.net)
- Policy journalism (POLITICO Europe)
- Advocacy orgs circulate to their MEP contacts

---

## Email Timing Considerations

- **Avoid:** Late December (holiday period), August (European summer break)
- **Optimal:** January-March (EU budget negotiations active), September-October (post-summer legislative session)
- **Current timing (mid-December):** Acceptable for seeding with Tier 1 organizations who can refine over holidays, broader distribution in January

---

## Additional Contacts to Research

Some organizations don't have obvious general contact emails but are worth reaching:

- **OSI (Open Source Initiative):** European board members
- **TODO Group:** Corporate OSPO network
- **European Commission DG CONNECT:** Digital policy directorate (via advocacy orgs, not direct)
- **Specific MEPs:** Those on ITRE (Industry, Research, Energy) or BUDG (Budget) committees who've shown digital policy interest

Advocacy organizations (Tier 1) will have these relationships and appropriate contact methods.

---

## Notes on Approach

**For organizations:** Professional, collegial tone. "We've drafted this framework based on community discussions and current policy developments. Your feedback would be valuable."

**For individuals:** Respectful of time. "We know you're busy; this is a framework proposal you might find relevant to ongoing funding discussions."

**For media:** News angle. "NGI cuts + STF success + EU budget negotiations = opportunity for coordinated framework. Here's the proposal."

**For everyone:** Emphasize this is community document seeking refinement, not finished product demanding endorsement. Invitation to improve rather than request to rubber-stamp.
