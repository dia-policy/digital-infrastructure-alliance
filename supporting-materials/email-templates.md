## Template A: For Tier 1 Advocacy Organizations
### (Open Forum Europe, FSFE, Sovereign Tech Agency, Linux Foundation Europe)

**Subject:** Community framework proposal: Digital Infrastructure Alliance

**Body:**

Hello,

I'm reaching out as someone who's been following the convergence of several concerning trends: the elimination of NGI funding from the 2025 Horizon Europe draft, the ongoing EU budget negotiations for 2028-2034, and the broader challenges around open source infrastructure sustainability.

Watching Germany's Sovereign Tech Fund demonstrate what's possible while seeing NGI face cuts made me think there's an opportunity here for something more coordinated. I've drafted a policy framework proposing a multinational "Digital Infrastructure Alliance"—essentially applying the NATO burden-sharing model to open source infrastructure funding.

The core idea: treaty-based cooperation where participating democracies pool resources (proportional to GDP) to fund critical open source infrastructure. Initial projections suggest 10-15 founding members could generate €200-300M annually in coordinated funding, providing sustainability for maintainers while distributing costs equitably.

I'm attaching the full brief (17 pages). The timing seems relevant given:
- EU budget negotiations underway now (2028-2034 MFF)
- Germany's STF providing operational model and momentum
- Digital sovereignty rhetoric that needs concrete implementation mechanisms
- Window closing as budget discussions progress

I have no illusions about my expertise relative to yours—you're the ones actually working in this space. If the framework seems worth refining and advocating for, I'd be grateful for your feedback. If it's impractical or redundant with existing efforts, that's valuable to know too.

The document is released under CC BY 4.0, so you're welcome to adapt, incorporate into other advocacy materials, or use however serves the cause.

Thanks for the work you do on these issues.

## Template B: For Technical Community Leaders / Projects
### (GNOME, KDE, Debian, major maintainers)

**Subject:** Policy framework proposal for sustainable infrastructure funding

**Body:**

Hi,

I've been watching the open source funding situation evolve—NGI getting cut despite supporting 500+ projects, Germany's STF showing what public funding can accomplish, and EU budget negotiations happening right now for 2028-2034. It struck me that there's a gap between good individual initiatives (STF) and the scale of need.

I drafted a policy framework proposing coordinated multinational funding for open source infrastructure, modeled on organizations like NATO or ESA where participating countries pool resources. The idea: €200-300M annually from 10-15 democratic nations, treaty-based governance, technical merit driving funding decisions rather than politics.

The attached brief (17 pages) lays out the case and implementation roadmap. I'm sharing it with advocacy organizations that engage with policymakers, but also wanted to put it in front of folks who actually maintain critical infrastructure and understand the sustainability challenges firsthand.

If this seems like a framework worth supporting or refining, great. If there are technical or practical problems I've missed, I'd appreciate knowing that before it gets circulated more widely.

No pressure to respond if you're buried in actual work—I know policy documents are less urgent than code. But figured it might be relevant given current policy discussions.

Best,
[Your name]

## Template C: For Media / Journalism
### (LWN.net, The Register, Netzpolitik, POLITICO Europe)

**Subject:** Story idea: Multinational framework for open source funding

**Body:**

Hi,

I've noticed your coverage of the NGI funding elimination and Germany's Sovereign Tech Fund. There's an interesting policy opportunity developing around the intersection of these trends and current EU budget negotiations.

I've drafted a framework proposal for a multinational "Digital Infrastructure Alliance"—applying the NATO burden-sharing model to open source infrastructure funding. The core argument: rather than fragmented national programs, participating democracies could pool resources (€200-300M annually based on GDP contributions) to sustainably fund critical infrastructure.

The timing is relevant because:
- EU 2028-2034 budget negotiations are happening now (window closes Q2 2026)
- NGI cuts have created community anger and policy attention
- Germany's STF proves the model works but doesn't scale alone
- Digital sovereignty rhetoric needs concrete implementation

I'm attaching the full policy brief (17 pages). I've also sent it to advocacy organizations (Open Forum Europe, FSFE, Sovereign Tech Agency) who might champion it.

Thought it might be worth a story, either as analysis of the funding landscape or as coverage of emerging policy proposals in this space. Happy to provide additional context if useful.

Thanks for considering it.

## Template D: For Research Institutions
### (Fraunhofer ISI, European University Institute)

**Subject:** Framework proposal building on EU-STF feasibility study

**Body:**

Hello,

I read your feasibility study on the European Sovereign Tech Fund with great interest. The analysis of governance models, design criteria, and budgetary considerations was excellent.

Building on that work, I've drafted a framework that extends the concept to multinational rather than EU-only governance—essentially arguing for a treaty-based organization (like NATO or ESA) that would allow broader democratic participation while maintaining the core STF principles your study outlined.

The attached brief proposes a "Digital Infrastructure Alliance" with €200-300M annual funding from participating nations, burden-sharing based on GDP, and governance that balances political oversight with technical merit in funding decisions.

I'm sharing this with advocacy organizations and policy contacts, but also wanted to put it in front of researchers who've done the serious analytical work on these questions. If the framework seems sound and worth developing further, great. If there are structural problems or missed considerations from the research perspective, that feedback would be valuable before broader circulation.

Thanks for the foundational work that made this kind of proposal thinkable.

Best regards,
[Your name]

## Template E: Short Version for Social Media / Forum Posts
### (Mastodon, Reddit, mailing lists)

**Subject/Post:**

With NGI funding cut and EU budget negotiations underway, I drafted a policy framework for sustainable open source infrastructure funding: a multinational "Digital Infrastructure Alliance" modeled on NATO/ESA burden-sharing.

Core idea: 10-15 democracies pool €200-300M annually (proportional to GDP) to fund critical infrastructure. Treaty-based governance, technical merit driving decisions, learning from Germany's STF success.

Feedback welcome, especially from folks working on these policy issues or maintaining infrastructure projects.

## Key Personalization Points

When sending, customize:

1. **For advocacy orgs:** Emphasize their expertise, position this as supporting their work
2. **For technical folks:** Acknowledge their time constraints, frame as relevant to their interests
3. **For media:** Lead with news angle and timing
4. **For everyone:** Make clear this is seeking feedback, not demanding endorsement

---

## Timing Recommendations

**Best:** 
- January 2-15 (post-holidays, pre-budget intensification)
- September-October (post-summer break, active legislative period)

**Acceptable:**
- Mid-December (for Tier 1 orgs who can review over holidays)
- March-April (still within budget negotiation window)

**Avoid:**
- Late December (24-31)
- August (European summer break)
- Late June (end of legislative session rush)

---

## Follow-up Strategy

**If no response after 2 weeks:**
- For organizations: One polite follow-up, then assume they're not interested/too busy
- For individuals: No follow-up (respect their time)
- For media: One follow-up if there's a news hook (budget vote, policy announcement)

**If positive response:**
- Ask what would make it more useful for their advocacy/coverage
- Offer to connect them with other interested parties
- Be responsive to feedback and willing to revise

**If critical response:**
- Thank them for engagement
- Address concerns if possible
- Revise document if criticism is valid
- Don't be defensive—they likely know more than you do

---

## Final Notes

**Tone throughout:** Professional but not pompous, knowledgeable but not presumptuous. You've done work and research, but you're not positioning yourself as an expert—you're a concerned community member contributing to a conversation.

**The "I'm just a normal person" framing works because:**
- It's true
- It's relatable (policy doesn't require credentials, just engagement)
- It reduces defensive responses (not claiming authority)
- It invites collaboration rather than critique

**What you're really saying:**
"I see a problem, I see an opportunity, I tried to think it through systematically. Here's what I came up with. People who know more than me: is this useful? Can we make it better?"

That's a much stronger position than "Here's the answer to everything" would be.
